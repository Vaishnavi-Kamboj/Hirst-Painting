🎨 Hirst Painting using Python (Turtle Graphics)

This project recreates the famous Damien Hirst dot painting style using Python’s Turtle Graphics module.
It creates a stunning grid of randomly colored dots inspired by modern art — simple, creative, and fun to code!

💡 Features

Generates a 10x10 grid of colorful dots

Each dot’s color is randomly chosen from a predefined color palette

Uses the Turtle module for graphics and Random for color variation

Visually appealing output that changes with every run

🧠 Concepts Covered

Loops and Iteration in Python

Turtle Graphics basics (dot, forward, penup, setheading)

RGB color mode using turtle.colormode(255)

Random color selection using the random module

(Optional) Extracting colors from an image using the colorgram library

⚙️ Requirements

Python 3.x

Modules:

turtle (comes pre-installed with Python)

colorgram.py (optional, for extracting colors from images)

random (standard library)

To install colorgram, run:

pip install colorgram.py

💻 How to Run

Clone this repository or download the Python file.

Place an image named hirst.jpg in the same directory if you want to extract colors dynamically.

Run the Python script using:

python hirst_painting.py


A window will open showing your generated Hirst-style dot painting.

Click anywhere on the screen to exit once it’s done.
